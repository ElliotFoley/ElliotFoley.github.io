		<h2>After/during assignment 1</h2>
		<p>10/10/2021, like 10 o'clock A.M. or something</p>
		<p style="inline">Fortunately, this assignment was very easy, so I was able to successfully procrastinate it until a day before it was due. I'm not sure I will be able to do that for the other assignments, but it was nice while it lasted. I'm not sure how much I'll really use Campuswire. Usually I like to code at times when other people aren't awake, and it's just easier to Google it and figure it out myself. The bonus points do seem nice, but I don't think I have any chance of getting them, especially with a class so big and full of people who already know stuff about web design.</p>
